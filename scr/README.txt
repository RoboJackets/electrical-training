# To use these scripts, locate the eagle.scr file under your default eagle directory in the folder "{eagle}/scr".
#
# Rename this file eagle.scr.old
#
# Copy the eagle.scr file found in the {github}/scr folder into your {eagle}/scr folder.
# Eagle will now call this file instead of the default on startup.
#
# Note: You will need administrative privledges to do this.
#
# Next, go to the Eagle control panel (the first window on startup)
# Select options > directories...
# Find your path to {github}/scr and copy it
# Into both the User Launguage Program and Scripts boxes, add a semicolon; then paste that path.
